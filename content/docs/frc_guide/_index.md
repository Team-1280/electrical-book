# There and Back Again: Making an FRC Electrical System

![Pilot tied to an F16's missile hardpoint](/electrical-book/img/aaq.jpg#center)

Welcome to the full guide on how to create an FRC-compliant electrical board. This guide should introduce you to every step of the process involved in wiring a 
robot, from the communications with other subteams to where to run the wires.

Whenever a part is mentioned in the guide, a link to the [parts reference](/electrical-book/docs/reference)
will be inserted, so you can explore all of the parts that one could expect to use in a build season.

[This guide](/electrical-book/docs/devboards) will also provide you information on giving your hobbies a brain and teaching you the basics to power your projects and tools to power it. Certain applications with more intesive applications might need to be fueled by a stronger [Arm](/electrical-book/docs/sbc). These will power the frequencies in the wires but for FRC you'll only be using the [RoboRio](/electrical-book/docs/modules/roborio.md)

Unfortunately, before we experience happiness, we must first experience the [Concepts of Electrical Engineering](/electrical-book/docs/structure/ee/ohmslaw)

When you're done reading up on that, let's start [building the board](/electrical-book/docs/structure/overview)
