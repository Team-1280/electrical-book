# Multimeter

A multimeter, short for "multiple meter," is a versatile and indispensable electronic measuring instrument used in a wide range of applications, particularly in the fields of electronics, electrical engineering, and troubleshooting. This device is designed to provide accurate measurements of various electrical parameters, making it an essential tool for professionals and hobbyists alike. (ChatGPT3.5, 2023)

What a multi meter does is to measure the voltage / amp of a live circuit; measure the Hz of the given circuit for knowing the possible flow through a circuit; then there is continuity, testing the weather the eletricity flows throught a given circuit. Some multimeters also have a Temprature sensor when a thermistor is attached to the ports.
