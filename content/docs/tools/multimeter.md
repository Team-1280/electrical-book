>A multimeter, short for "multiple meter," is a versatile and indispensable electronic measuring instrument used in a wide range of applications, particularly in the fields of electronics, electrical engineering, and troubleshooting. This device is designed to provide accurate measurements of various electrical parameters, making it an essential tool for professionals and hobbyists alike. - ChatGPT3.5

The multimeter usually used for testing and understanding the functionalities of components. For say, there is a certain part of the circuit that seems to not work: Firstly, check all connections with your eyes, see if there are any shortcuts done by the previous engineer. If there seems to not be a physical issue, you being troubleshoot with your multimeter, check for voltage drops and/r current drops. With what? The ***Multimeter***. 

What a multi meter does is to measure the voltage / amp of a live circuit; measure the Hz of the given circuit for knowing the possible flow through a circuit; then there is continuity, testing the weather the eletricity flows throught a given circuit. Some multimeters also have a Temprature sensor when a thermistor is attached to the ports.  

You will be learning the different parts of a multi meter in the following diagram, see the following diagram:
