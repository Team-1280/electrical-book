>A bench power supply, also known as a laboratory power supply or bench power source, is a piece of electronic test equipment used to provide a controlled and adjustable voltage and current output to power and test electronic devices and circuits. It is commonly found in laboratories, workshops, and electronics testing environments. -ChatGPT 3.5 Turbo

A bench top power supply is a power source used commonly to test circuits and modules. The bench top has a distinct feature which basically gives a pumping heart to the copper blood vessels. The power supply can control the flow of blood, and oxygen intensity. The benchtop uses a series of MOSFETs to control the voltage and amp of electricity. Shifting the dials could help you determine power and speed of eletricity flowing through circuit. 

## Quick Start
As the name suggests, the bench tester is a item that is used to test voltages and amp. You are given 2 dials, 3 ports, and 2 probes for a standard Bench Tester. The bench tester has these for the user to test the circuit. The dial for voltage controls the voltage and the dial for current manipulates the amp. **Be careful of the amp and voltage.**  

*Reminder: that when you are done with the Bench Tester, please remember to turn down the dial before you turn off the bench.*
