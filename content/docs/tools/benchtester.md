*I know amazing photo right stolen off amazon XD*

## Quick Start
As the name suggests, the bench tester is a item that is used to test voltages and amp. You are given 2 dials, 3 ports, and 2 probes for a standard Bench Tester. The bench tester has these for the user to test the circuit. The dial for voltage controls the voltage and the dial for current manipulates the amp. **Be careful of the amp and voltage.**  

*Reminder: that when you are done with the Bench Tester, please remember to turn down the dial before you turn off the bench.*
