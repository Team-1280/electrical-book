# Oscilloscope - for people with OCD

> An oscilloscope, formerly known as an oscillograph (informally scope, oscope, or o-scope), is an instrument that graphically displays electrical signals and shows how those signals change over time. It measures these signals by connecting with a sensor, which is a device that creates an electrical signal in response to physical stimuli like sound, light and heat. For instance, a microphone is a sensor that converts sound into an electrical signal. -Tektronix

**An Engineer's stethoscope.**

A Oscilloscope is a modern version of stethoscope for engineers, hackers, and hobbiests to understand the voltage over time in a given circuit. For example, your circuit seems to not recieve information from a certain sensor and might need to check if the voltage of the sensor is being detected, you would take the probes from the Oscilloscope to check weather there are signals from the sensor. It functions as a more functional contunity tester.

A Oscilloscope functions on a 3 subsystem that collabarate together to recreate the frequency in which the eletrical circuit is giving it's analog/digital output; the functions are, *Vertical*, *Horizontal*, and *Trigger subsystems*.

The signal is amplified so the Analog to Digital can read it. Than through a Analog to Digital convertor changes it to a digital frequency so the output can be displayed, the waveform data was viewed in a screen.
