# Tools & Msc Items

![Youwen's painful photo](/electrical-book/img/IMG_1665.jpg)

In wire alchemy, there are 3 main tools that each engineer should equip themselves with. From developing a industrial grade robot to reverse engineering the Xbox. The big 3 are: 

* [Multimeter](/electrical-book/docs/tools/multimeter)
* [Benchtop Power Supply](/electrical-book/docs/tools/benchtester)
* [Oscilloscope](/electrical-book/docs/tools/ocd)

In short the **Multimeter** checks for life, a **Benchtop** gives life, and a **Oscillioscope** peforms a CT scan. 

These are tools, you can't just stick random needle probes without thinking. Remember to recieve proper training before dealing a irreversable consiquence.
