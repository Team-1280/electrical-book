# Single Board Computers

![SBC fossil](/electrical-book/img/sbchistory.JPG)

As the name suggests, it is a single board computer that functions as a Microcontroller, having a GPIO pins on the side and a pretty beefy processor, it can lift any task easily with it's ARM chip(usually). Usually these intricate pieces of Fiberglass and Copper and Silicon run on a *nix system and is required to function as a single board computer. Again these boards typically runs small and simple projects such as [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) or [RetroPie](https://retropie.org.uk/) which are small scale open source projects relating to the hardware. Many of these projects support the [RaspberryPi Family](/electrical-book/docs/sbc/raspberrypi) more due to it's popularity, but many clones have also emerged throughout the years.   

To view all of these single board computers in one place, visit [SBC Database](https://hackerboards.com/ "boardsdb.com").   

## What are the use cases for each board

Many of the popular ones include **[Nvidia Jetson](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/jetson-developer-kits)** which are typically used to develop AI-based applications. **[Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/)** which is the more supported and the most hacked among the community, support for these boards are extraordaniry and can be many versatile applications. 

The **[Odroid](https://www.hardkernel.com/product/)** and **[BeagleBoards](https://www.beagleboard.org/boards)** a good introduction to SBC and their pros, Odroid and BeagleBoards are commonly used for primarily headless servers and Linux-based Applications, due to their sizes they are not commonly found in handhealds.  
 
**[BananaPi](https://www.banana-pi.org/en/banana-pi-sbcs/)** and **[OrangePi](http://www.orangepi.org/html/hardWare/computerAndMicrocontrollers/index.html)** and **[Radxa](https://radxa.com/products)** are the boards to go for handheald and cyberdecks, typically small form factor and lower power draw means the CPU&RAM combo packs a punch many of these boards support Linux and emulator-focused OSes.  

For a cheap aalternative with all of the functionality of a Raspberry Pi is the **[LibreComputer](https://libre.computer/products/aml-s905x-cc/)** and **[Asus Tynker Board](https://www.asus.com/us/networking-iot-servers/aiot-industrial-solutions/all-series/tinker-board/)** popular with building cluster due to the price to peformance.  

A beefy, strong, and out peforming sbcs are the **[IntelNUC](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/details/nuc/boards/products.html)**, **[LattePanda](https://www.lattepanda.com/)**, **[Zimaboard](https://www.zimaboard.com/zimaboard/product)**, and **[UDOO](https://www.udoo.org/discover-the-udoo-bolt/)**; breaking the boundries of what one 5 Layer PCB can do and peform.  

If you don't want the hassle of creating the computer, the **[PINE64 Foundation](https://pine64.com/)** produces hardware that fufill the portable Linux experience.  

Finally Arm Chip manufactures such as: **[Rockchip](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/2255799937473030.html?ws_ab_test=searchweb0_0%2Csearchweb201602_0%2Csearchweb201603_0%2CppcSwitch_0&algo_pvid=efd5558c-ecb4-451c-92d7-2dcd081f8841&algo_expid=efd5558c-ecb4-451c-92d7-2dcd081f8841-13&gatewayAdapt=glo2usa4itemAdapt)** will create powerful sbc experience.  

### Boards:

**[RaspberryPi Family](/electrical-book/docs/sbc/raspberrypi)** - A singleboard computer common to the community, Powerful processor Arm-based for Linux.
