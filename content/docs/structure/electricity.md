# Just the Concepts of Electrical Engineering You Need

Don't tell the college admissions officials I blatantly lied to here but an advanced knowledge of electrical engineering is not generally required to create an FRC electrical board.

That's not to say that understanding electricity will not help you, and a basic knowledge of DC voltage and current will be required.
That is what this section will attempt to teach- an understanding of what is actually happening in the wires when you plug them in.

## What voltage, current, and resistance actually do

Let's get right into it with `current`. When electricity flows through a wire, `charges` can be imagined to move in the wire like water in a pipe.
(Get used to the pipe metaphor, electrical engineers love it)

Unlike water, however, electrical charges flow at nearly the speed of light through the wire.

### Current

Current measures the number of charges passing through a point in the wire per second.
Current is measured in `amperes`, but everyone calls them `amps` because it sounds cooler.
It essentially measures how 'much' electricity is flowing through a wire, like measuring how much water flows through a pipe.


So to recap, we plug a battery's `+` and `-` terminals into a circuit and current flows from the battery's + terminal to the battery's - terminal.
But what determines how much current actually flows through a simple circuit, like an LED light? That requires the help of two other measurements.

### Voltage

Officially, voltage is a measure of the electrical potential difference between two points.
Let's simplify that because it's a stupid way to introduce a concept.
Imagine `Voltage` as a measurement of the force that pushes `current` through a wire.
If the voltage is higher, more current is shoved through the wire than if the voltage is lower.
