Welcome to the full guide on how to create an FRC-compliant electrical board. This guide should introduce you to every step of the process involved in wiring a 
robot, from the communications with other subteams to where to run the wires.

Whenever a part is mentioned in the guide, a link to the [parts reference](/electrical-book/docs/reference)
will be inserted, so you can explore all of the parts that one could expect to use in a build season.


Unfortunately, before we experience happiness, we must first experience the [Concepts of Electrical Engineering](/electrical-book/docs/structure/ee/ohmslaw)

When you're done reading up on that, let's start [building the board](/electrical-book/docs/structure/overview)
