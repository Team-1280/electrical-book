Welcome to the Team 1280 Electrical Handbook, containing everything needed to ascend from a mechanical grunt to an educated electrical erudite. This guide would add information on useful objects that might be useful for your personal projects. We encourage you to add to this github page and add on information. If there is any questions for your own help please submit a pull requeust on Github or send a discord message to the former eletrical people. We also encourage you to become a hobbyist and develop your own projects.

This handbook is divided into a **reference** section and a **book** section meant to take you through the process of building an electrical board.
When reading the book section, make sure to follow any links to things you haven't yet learned of - if it's linked to a page, it's expected that you've familiarized yourself with it.

[This guide](/electrical-book/docs/devboards) will provide you information on giving your hobbies a brain and teaching you the basics to power your projects and tools to power it. Certain applications with more intesive applications might need to be fueled by a stronger [Arm](/electrical-book/docs/sbc). These will power the frequencies in the wires but for FRC you'll only be using the [RoboRio](/electrical-book/docs/reference/modules/roborio).

See [Making an FRC Electrical Board](docs/frc_guide) for a start-to-finish guide.

See [Electrical Reference](docs/reference) for a full reference of every part that you should encounter in a typical FRC electrical system.

See [Tools](docs/tools) for information on how to use certain tools and properly use the tools

See [DevBoards](docs/devboards) for information on development board manufactures and their pros and cons

See [SBC](docs/sbc) for information on single board computers that might pose a use in your day to day projects

If you plan to add and contribute to this handbook, see [Contributing](docs/contributing) for setting up your development environment and a style guide.
